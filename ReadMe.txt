Project:
    Use SDL and OpenGL to make a sand simulation with sand, water, fire, 
    and static metal/wood. Implement physics, and a movable player. Implement tools/guns.
    Program the whole project with industry standards in mind.
Purpose:
    The Purpose of this project is to hone my programming skills in c++; learn about low level programming -for
    the increase in creative freedom-
    learn more about OpenGL and Computer
    Graphics; simulate basic physics; create a
Programming Fundamentals:
    -I seek to improve my aptitude in soft skills such as: 
        Organization, Time management, Self set deadlines, and 
    -I seek to improve my aptitude in hard skills such as:
        Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation
    -I seek to learn new
        Algorithms, data structures, and APIs
